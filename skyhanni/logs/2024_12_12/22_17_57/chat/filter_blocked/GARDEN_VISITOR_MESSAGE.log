10:41:57 §e[NPC] §aLeo§f: §r§fSadly you can't gather logs in the §aThe Garden§f, however there are plenty of crops here!
10:41:58 §e[NPC] §aLeo§f: §r§fUntil next time!
10:41:59 §e[NPC] §aMason§f: §r§fI paid for one of Treasure Hunter's tips today and again, it only led me to a dirty shoelace. His tips are just not worth it...
10:42:00 §e[NPC] §aMason§f: §r§fMaybe if I continue buying his tips I'll hit the jackpot soon. Just gotta spend a little bit more...
10:42:00 §e[NPC] §9Shifty§f: §r§fIt seems like my brew selection is rather small...I've recently heard that melon juice is really sought after so maybe it can enhance my drinks' flavors!

10:42:05 §e[NPC] §aRoyal Resident§f: §r§fThis is acceptable. I would never eat this myself, but it's good enough for my servants.
